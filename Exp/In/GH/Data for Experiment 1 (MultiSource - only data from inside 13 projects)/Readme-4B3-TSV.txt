Final dataset folder (version B: complete cleaned text, filtered to include just SO tags),
	4B3-TSV: Just 13 main FASE projects (with issues enabled):

This dataset includes the same as "4-A3-TSV", but it has the short version of textual fields:
	i.e., the "non SO tags" are removed. Also SO tags with length <= 2 are removed.
	(for project description, it also adds one/two possible tags from the project title; e.g., angular/angular.js to the end of project description).

This version is NOT APPROPRIATE for those researchers who want to "re-run our program" on our data set.
It has cleanings that are specific to our algorithm and is not useful for publishing.
